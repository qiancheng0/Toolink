### Instruction:
Multiply a matrix of shape (2,2,2) with a matrix of shape (2,2,1). Add the result to a matrix of shape (2,2,1). Compute the kronecker product of the result with a matrix of shape (2,4,3).
Use the tool given in the input to write python code to solve the problem.
### Input:
- Tool 1:
multiply: it takes in two lists representing the shape of two matrix, and returns the shape of their product.
```python
def multiply(shape1, shape2):
    ...
    return result_shape
```
- Tool 2:
kronecker: it takes in two list representing the shape of two matrix, and returns the shape of their kronecker product.
```python
def kronecker(shape1, shape2):
    ...
    return result_shape
```
- Tool 3:
add_subtract_hadamard: it takes two lists representing the shape of two matrices for add, sbstract and hadamard, and returns the shape of the resulting matrix.
```python
def add_subtract_hadamard(shape1, shape2):
    return shape1
```
- Plan
The useful tool is [[add_subtract_hadamard]], [[multiply]], [[kronecker]].
First use [[multiply]] to calculate the shape of product.
Next use [[add_subtract_hadamard]] to calculate the shape of sum.
Finally we use [[kronecker]] to calculate the shape of kronecker product.
### Response:
```python
result = multiply([2,2,2], [2,2,1])
result = add_subtract_hadamard(result, [2,2,1])
result = kronecker(result, [2,4,3])
print(result)
```
