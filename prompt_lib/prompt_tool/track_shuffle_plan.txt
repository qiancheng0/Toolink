- Question:
Alice, Bob, and Claire are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing left midfielder, Bob is playing fullback, and Claire is playing right midfielder. \n\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Alice and Claire trade positions. Then, Bob and Alice trade positions. Finally, Claire and Alice trade positions. At the end of the match, Bob is playing
- Available tools:
1. create_object_dict: this tool takes in a list of people and their initial object, and returns a dictionary mapping each person to their object.
2. update_object_dict: this tool takes in an object dictionary, a list of object trades, and updates the object dictionary based on the trades.
3. parse_trades: this tool takes in a string of trades and returns a list of individual trades.
4. get_final_object: this tool takes in a object dictionary and returns the object held by the target person finally.
### Response:
The useful tools are [[create_object_dict]], [[update_object_dict]] and [[get_final_object]].
I should first use [[create_object_dict]] to create a dictionary mapping each person with the position at the start. Then I should use [[update_object_dict]] to update the dictionary with a list of trades between Alice and Claire, Bob and Alice, and finally Claire and Alice. Finally, I should use [[get_final_object]] to get the final position played by Bob.

### Response:
The useful tools include [[update_object_dict]], [[create_object_dict]] and [[get_final_object]].
[[create_object_dict]] can help me create a dictionary mapping each person with the book in the beginning. Then I should use [[update_object_dict]] to record the trade of books between Dave and Fred, Dave and Eve. Finally, I should use [[get_final_object]] to get the book held by Eve.
