How many passionfruits are in the room?\n- Available tools:\n1. divide_remain: it takes in a, b, and c, and checks if the remainder of a divided by b is equal to c\n2. check_validity: it takes into a list of possible answers, and filters the list of answers based on the upper bound x\n### Response:\n", "response": "The useful tool is [[divide_remain]] and [[check_validity]]. The function [[divide_remain]] should be called for three times to check if the remainder is correct. Then [[check_validity]] should be called to filter out the valid answers based on the upperbound.", "answer": 2172.0, "source": "toolplan"}
