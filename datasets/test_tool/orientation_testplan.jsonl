Take 3 steps. Turn around. Turn left. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Turn around. Take 6 steps. Take 10 steps.\n- Available tools:\n1. update_orientation: It takes the original orientation(N, E, S or W) and turn direction(left, right or around), and returns the new orientation. It should be used only if not always face forward.\n2. update_location: It takes the current location(x, y), orientation(N, E, S or W), and steps, and returns the new location after action.\n### Response:\n", "response": "The useful tool is [[update_location]] and [[update_orientation]]. Because not always facing forward, suppose the start location is (0, 0) and the start orientation is N. Every time we take turn, we should use [[update_orientation]] to get the new orientation. Then we can use [[update_location]] to calculate the new location, until we reach the final.", "answer": "True", "source": "toolplan"}
