### Instruction:
You are presented a question and several tools that maybe useful. Select the useful tools and plan how to solve the problem.
### Input:
- Question:
Multiply a matrix of shape (2,2,2) with a matrix of shape (2,2,1). Add the result to a matrix of shape (2,2,1). Compute the kronecker product of the result with a matrix of shape (2,4,3).
- Available tools:
1. multiply: it takes in two lists representing the shape of two matrix, and returns the shape of their product.
2. kronecker: it takes in two list representing the shape of two matrix, and returns the shape of their kronecker product.
3. sum_over_axis: it takes a list representing the shape of the matrix, and the dimension of the axis that is to be sum up. It returns the shape of the resulting matrix.
4. transpose: it takes a list representing the shape of a matrix to be transposed, and returns the shape of the resulting matrix.
5. add_subtract_hadamard: it takes two lists representing the shape of two matrices for add, sbstract and hadamard, and returns the shape of the resulting matrix.
### Response:
The useful tool is [[add_subtract_hadamard]], [[multiply]], [[kronecker]].
First use [[multiply]] to calculate the shape of product.
Next use [[add_subtract_hadamard]] to calculate the shape of sum.
Finally we use [[kronecker]] to calculate the shape of kronecker product.
