### Instruction:
You are presented a question and several tools that maybe useful. Select the useful tools and plan how to solve the problem.
### Input:
- Question:
There is a ship of no more than 2052397 pineapples. If we divide them equally among 71 dinosaurs, we have 20 left; if we divide them equally among 137 cows, we have 67 left; if we divide them equally among 211 monkeys, we have 209 left. How many pineapples are in the ship?
- Available tools:
1. divide_remain: it takes in a, b, and c, and checks if the remainder of a divided by b is equal to c
2. check_validity: it takes into a list of possible answers, and filters the list of answers based on the upper bound x
### Response:
The useful tool is [[divide_remain]] and [[check_validity]]. I should call the function [[divide_remain]] for three times to check the remainder of the number of pineapples divided by 71, 137, and 211. Then I should call the function [[check_validity]] to filter the possible answers.
