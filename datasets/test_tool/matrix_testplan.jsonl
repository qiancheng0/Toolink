Compute the kronecker product of the result with a matrix of shape (4,4,2).\n- Available tools:\n1. multiply: it takes in two lists representing the shape of two matrix, and returns the shape of their product.\n2. kronecker: it takes in two list representing the shape of two matrix, and returns the shape of their kronecker product.\n3. sum_over_axis: it takes a list representing the shape of the matrix, and the dimension of the axis that is to be sum up. It returns the shape of the resulting matrix.\n4. transpose: it takes a list representing the shape of a matrix to be transposed, and returns the shape of the resulting matrix.\n5. add_subtract_hadamard: it takes two lists representing the shape of two matrices for add, sbstract and hadamard, and returns the shape of the resulting matrix.\n### Response:\n", "response": "The useful tool is [[add_subtract_hadamard]], [[multiply]] and [[kronecker]].\nFirst use [[multiply]] to calculate the shape of product.\nNext use [[add_subtract_hadamard]] to calculate the shape of sum.\nThen we use [[kronecker]] to calculate the shape of kronecker product as the final result.", "answer": "[12, 12, 2]", "source": "toolplan"}
