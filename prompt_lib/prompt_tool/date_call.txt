### Instruction:
Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date 3 days later in MM/DD/YYYY?
Use the tool given in the input to write python code to solve the problem. Please wrap the code in your response in ```python...```
### Input:
- Tool 1:
subtract_time: It takes in the start day in format MM/DD/YYYY, and calculate the date y years, m months and d days before this day. It returns a string in format MM/DD/YYYY.
```python
import datetime
def subtract_time(start_day, years=0, months=0, days=0):
    ...
    return new_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
```
- Tool 2:
add_time: It takes in the start day in format MM/DD/YYYY, and calculate the date after y years, m months and d days. It returns a string in format MM/DD/YYYY.
```python
import datetime
def add_time(start_day, years=0, months=0, days=0):
    ...
    return new_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
```
- Plan
The useful tool is [[subtract_time]] and [[add_time]]. Tomorrow is 11/12/2019, so I should use [[subtract_time]] to subtract 1 day from 11/12/2019 to get the date today. I am asked to calculate the date 3 days later, so I should use [[add_time]] to add 3 day to today's date and get the target date.
### Response:
```python
start = "11/12/2019"
# first calculate today's date
today_date = subtract_time(start, years=0, months=0, days=1)
target_date = add_time(today_date, years=0, months=0, days=3)
print(target_date)
```
