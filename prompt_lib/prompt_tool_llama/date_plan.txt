### Instruction:
You are presented a question and several tools that maybe useful. Select the useful tools and plan how to solve the problem.
### Input:
- Question:
Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date 3 days later in MM/DD/YYYY?
- Available tools:
1. add_time: It takes in the start day in format MM/DD/YYYY, and calculate the date after y years, m months and d days. It returns a string in format MM/DD/YYYY.
2. subtract_time: It takes in the start day in format MM/DD/YYYY, and calculate the date y years, m months and d days before this day. It returns a string in format MM/DD/YYYY.
3. convert_hour: It takes the number of hours and convert it into days (integer).
### Response:
The useful tool is [[subtract_time]] and [[add_time]]. Tomorrow is 11/12/2019, so I should use [[subtract_time]] to subtract 1 day from 11/12/2019 to get the date today. I am asked to calculate the date 3 days later, so I should use [[add_time]] to add 3 day to today's date and get the target date.
